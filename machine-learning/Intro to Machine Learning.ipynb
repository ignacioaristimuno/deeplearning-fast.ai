    "The first step in any Machine Learning project is to get familiarized with the data. In this course we will be using `Pandas` library for this. Pandas is the primary tool data scientists use for exploring and manipulating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important part of the Pandas library is the `DataFrame`. A DataFrame holds the type of data you might think of as a table. This is similar to a sheet in Excel, or a table in a SQL database. Pandas has powerful methods for most things you'll want to do with this type of data\n",

    "First, we will have to get the data from Kaggle, in this case the dataset that we will be using is *Melbourne housing snapshot*. To achieve this we can use Kaggle's API as the code that follows:"

    "### 1.1 Interpreting Data Description\n",
    "\n",
    "The results show 8 fields for each column in your original dataset. The first field `count` shows how many rows have non-missing values.\n",
    "\n",
    "Missing values arise for many reasons. For example, the size of the 2nd bedroom wouldn't be collected when surveying a 1 bedroom house. We'll come back to the topic of missing data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second value is the `mean`, which is the average. Under that, `std` is the standard deviation, which measures how numerically spread out the values are.\n",
    "\n",
    "To interpret the min, 25%, 50%, 75% and max values, imagine sorting each column from lowest to highest value. The first (smallest) value is the `min`. If you go a quarter way through the list, you'll find a number that is bigger than 25% of the values and smaller than 75% of the values. That is the 25% value (pronounced `\"25th percentile\"`). The 50th (`the median`) and `75th percentile` are defined analogously, and the `max` is the largest number.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1.2 Selecting Data for Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally, datasets have too many variables to wrap your head around, or even to print out nicely. How can you pare down this overwhelming amount of data to something you can understand?\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll start by picking a few variables using our intuition. There are also more advanced statistical techniques to automatically prioritize variables. On later Kaggle courses you can learn about them. \n",
    "\n",
    "To choose variables/columns, we'll need to see a list of all columns in the dataset. That is done with the `columns property` of the DataFrame:"

The most straightforward way to do this is to exclude some data from the model-building process, and then use those to test the model's accuracy on data it hasn't seen before. This data is called `validation data`.\n",

If we keep doubling the number of groups by adding more splits at each level, we'll have  2<sup>10</sup>  groups of houses by the time we get to the 10th level. That's 1024 leaves.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we divide the houses amongst many leaves, we also have fewer houses in each leaf. Leaves with very few houses will make predictions that are quite close to those homes' actual values, but they may make very unreliable predictions for new data (because each prediction is based on only a few houses).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a phenomenon called `overfitting`, where a model matches the training data almost perfectly, but does poorly in validation and other new data. On the flip side, if we make our tree very shallow, it doesn't divide up the houses into very distinct groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "At an extreme, if a tree divides houses into only 2 or 4, each group still has a wide variety of houses. Resulting predictions may be far off for most houses, even in the training data (and it will be bad in validation too for the same reason). When a model fails to capture important distinctions and patterns in the data, so it performs poorly even in training data, that is called `underfitting`.\n",
