# deeplearning-kaggle-course
This repository is meant for my own course for keeping track of Kaggle's course on deeplearning. This is set to public in case someone finds it handy. In case of wanting some explanation or details con the repository don't hesitate to contact me.

Also, this is not the exact content of Kaggle's notebooks, this repository provides the summary that best fitted my learning and will be used for further consulting this material. You can find a link to this course in the next link: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-deep-learning
