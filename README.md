# kaggle-course
This repository is meant for for keeping my own track of Kaggle's courses for learning more about machine learning and deep learning. This is set to public in case someone finds it handy. In case of wanting some explanation or details on the repository don't hesitate to contact me.

Also, this is not the exact content of Kaggle's notebooks, this repository provides summaries of the courses that best fitted my learning and will be used as further consulting  material. You can find a link to these courses here: https://www.kaggle.com/learn/overview
